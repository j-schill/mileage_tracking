# Mileage Tracking Repository

Strava and Garmin track running mileage, but it would be nice to be able to monitor and track my own data.  This repository houses scripts and code to parse and analyze data exported from garmin connect.

# Work in progress

* Clean up repository
* Build ingestion pipeline - manually request 8 years of data to store here 2017-2025 (API would not work)



# Possible avenues for additional implementation

[`garmindb`](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB):  package to query garmin connect (had api issues)
[`garminconnect`](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/tree/master): more limited but successfully able to query recent garmin activities
